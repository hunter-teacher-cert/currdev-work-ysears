## Comparing AP CSP Curricula
I will be comparing the Code.org AP CSP curriculum with the Beauty and Joy of Computing curriculum.

## Major Differences
With the Beauty and Joy of Computing curriculum, there is a lot more focus on the programming topics of AP CSP. BJC also seems like it could be a self guided curriculum for students. Code.org takes a more simplistic approach, with less emphasis on the minute parts of programming and more on whole understanding.

## Major Similarities
Both curricula are heavily project based.They also both use very accessible languages that can go from block-based to text-based (Snap! and App Lab)

## Comparative Strengths and Weaknesses
In the BJC curriculum, students are able to really grasp the programming concepts because of the extensive coverage of these topics. In Code.org, the non-programming topics are covered extensively. There are also more teacher resources given in the Code.org curriculum (lesson plans, answer keys, etc) versus the BJC curriculum

## Adoption 
One thing I've said that I wanted to change while using the Code.org curriculum was giving my students more proactice with the programming aspects of the course. BJC has a great emphasis on these topics, so I wouldn't mind using some of the activities from this curriculum. (In the applicable language of course)
