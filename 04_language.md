Select one of the languages that were discussed in the breakout rooms that you feel would be a good fit for a course that you currently teach or would like to teach. (If it is reasonable, pick a language other than one you currently teach.)
Answer the following prompts:
### What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
AP CSP, grades 9-12, no prior formal experience in coding

### What is the language?
p5.js (Processing)

### How does one write & run code in this language?
Students would use a web application to write code, similar to the web application that Code.org has

### Rate the complexity of the syntax?
On a scale of 1 - 10, the complexity would be around a 7. It will be easier for students with prior programming experience and more difficult for those without.

### Strengths (How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?)
 * It is written in Javascript, which is more user friendly than Java 
 * There seems to be a lot of documentation for this language, which is great for students to reference.
* You can create art!
* To create something, you don't need massive amounts of code.

These strengths make this language a better choice for beginner programmers (outside of Python)

### Weaknesses (How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?)
* Text-based so there is very specific language used to run programs
* Students have to be more attentive to details to catch syntax errors
* To do more advanced art, you need more advanced coding.

I would teach students to use the documentation to their advantage! And to make sure I give enough time for processing (ha!) in classwork assignments/projects.

### Why did you select this language for this class?
The p5.js is, to me, a great language for students to be able to visually see what they are programming. It is text-based so it still has the rigor I'm looking to add to CSP, but is rewarding enough (in the visuals) for students to stay engaged.
