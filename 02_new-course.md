This activity is based off of my CS teaching experience at my previous school! :)

## Robotics: Programming with Python!
In this course, students would learn Python using robots as the medium. They would learn the fundamental of Python while being able to physically "see" their work.

The target audience (ideally) would be anyone interested in learning CS. Python is a beginner language, so there would be no pre-requiste courses.The student population that I worked with were, historically, below grade level in reading and math. Having a course where they can get into physical computing along with the programming bit would create more buy-in for the class.

This would be an alternate option to AP CSP, which was the only CS course offered at my previous school. It could be a more low-stakes exposure to CS and offered to a lot more students who wouldn't have to be "AP" course ready.
